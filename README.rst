Description
-----------
Bcon stands for Block CONnection. And we use it for:
* developing separate layout blocks and then reusing them to death
* forgetting about template dependencies
* ...
* PROFIT!

A note on bootstrap and Django love
-----------------------------------
We designed this for django and bootstrap.

What it can
-----------
* create a layout (and even project and apps!) from declaration

What it can not
---------------
* Do all shit for you. It just won't work. You need at least to understand what it does.
