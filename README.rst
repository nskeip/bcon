Description
-----------

Mmm... Bacon. An implementation of block-element-modyfier pattern. It is all about declarative way in html layout. In progress, bro. Wait a bit.


Requirements
------------
* argparse

What it can
-----------
* Can help you develop separate layout blocks (but if you do it _right_:)) and then reuse it to death
* Can help you to extend your layout
* Can help you forget about template dependencies - if you want to


What it can not
---------------
* It can not make your workflow faster. It is not about a web-page in 5 minutes. It is almost all about maintenance.
* Do all shit for you. It just won't work. You need at least to understand what it does.
